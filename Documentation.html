            Commands:
            commands are the basic triggers for your bot they tell your bot what to look out for
            they can be onMessageSend or onNewUserJoin these triggers make your bot respond to things
    
            onMessageSend:
            this is very self-explanatory it checks if a specific message is sent no matter if its in all caps or not its very vague.
            this can range from a Hello to 123.
            It can be any message.

            onAnyMessageSend:
            this is realy self-explanitory but it has a quirk that I must tell you about
            it makes the bot respond to any message sent as long as the message is not from another bot
            its because if it responds to bots it may cause lag
            just remember that this makes it respond to every message and may get annoying you have been warned
    
            onCommand:
            this is less self-explanatory and may confuse you a bit but its very simple when you understand.
            its not for slash commands.
            it is basicly like on onMessageSend but just more specififc witch means that the command has to be said exactly as its written.
    
            onNewUserJoin:
            it triggers when a new user joins your server.
            you can do many things with this commnd for starters making a welcome bot or you can make it ban people as soon as they join.

            Replys:
            Replys are what your bot does if a command is triggered if you dont know about commands go to the section above and READ IT.
            Replys can be replying to a message or banning you the skys the limit or atleast the amount of options are.

            reply:
            its the deafult setting
            it makes the bot reply to the message that is sent
            Do not use reply with the command onNewUserJoin it does not work and will give you an error

            sendMessage:
            this is very self-explanatory it makes the bot send a message

            sendDirectMessage:
            this is not as self-explanatory as the send message.
            it makes the bot send a direct message witch means the message is not sent in the server the bot is in but directly to the user.
            
            mentionSomebody:
            it makes the bot to mention somebody using their userName.
            yeah this is also experimental.

            mentionEveryone:
            it makes the bot mention everyone
            its that simple.

            giveRoleUsingId:
            this makes the bot give a role to people using its Id.
            it only works with the id NOT WITH THE ROLE NAME.

        Introduction:
        Ok finaly creating the bot woooooooooohooooooooo.
        
        What You Need To Install:
        ok so first you would need to download visual studio code ok Visula Studio Code not visual studio VISUAL STUDIO CODE
        next you need to install nodes.js
        
        Packages You Need To Install:
        then you need to write in the terminal (npm i discord.js)
        the you need to write in the terminal (npm init)
        only change the 
        .name
        .description
        .author
        if you want to skip this part use the command (npm init -y)

        you can find this basic process if you look at any discord bot tutorial

        Scripting:
        finaly you will create a .js by typing (Index.js) the file could be named any name you want you just have to add .js at the end
        then you paste the code you got from bot-Link in and thats it

        End:
        Ok so you made it to the end either you read throught the whole thing or you just scrolled to the bottom out of curiosity
        so Im going to tell you somethings that I feel your should know
        
        Updates:
        Yes Bot-Link will be updated once and a while to make it better and hopefully make it the best discord bot making website there is wish me luck
        I will also update the documentation but I will try to keep it the same

        Developer Note:
        I hope you enjoyed and benefited from bot-link because it took me sometime to learn how some of the code for discord.js works
        I also hope bot-link can help you learn how to make a discord bot

        If It Doesnt Work:
        if it doesnt work feel free to go to the V.A.T industries discord server and complain to us about your bot not working
        if you cant make the bot you want we also provide custom bot making services there
